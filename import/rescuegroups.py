import asm, os

"""
Import module to read from rescuegroups CSV export.

This is done with Reports, then Animals (All Fields) for adoptable and adopted, etc.
It produces an Animals.csv file.
If you use Animals->Exports, you can do a manual export for PetFinder that puts all
your images on their FTP server to pick up.

If RG are running slow, a custom report can be made with the following fields:

Animal ID, Internal ID, Status, Species, Name, Created, Last Updated, 
General Age, Mixed, Sex, Primary Breed, Secondary Breed, Color (General), 
Declawed, Special Needs, Altered, Housetrained, OK with Cats, OK with Kids, OK with Cats, 
Microchip Number, Description, Location, Summary, Picture 1

Will also import data from RG All Contacts report, called Contacts.csv:

Address, Comment, Email, First Name, Last Name, Phone (Cell), Phone (Home)


I think if people haven't paid for their "Data Management Service" they aren't allowed to
run any reports. This export will also work with CSVs extracted from Animals->Animal List,
change the View to Export and then hit Export as CSV.
